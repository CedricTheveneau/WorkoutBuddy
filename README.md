## Description :

Workout Buddy as an app meant to help you find people to practice with, no matter your level, we want to make sports/workout fun again, and makes you give up the "training is chore" mindset.

Feature-rich and community focused, this platform is built to be th perfect crossing for anyone interested in any sport.

Powered by our very own in-house library, [Lightning UI](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/), it's lightweight, responsive and beautiful, while having a unique aura.

## Languages used :

This app is built with React, using TypeScript, with the Lightning UI CSS library for the front-end.
For now, we don't have any back-end.

All yu have to do to install the app is to go to the [Workout Buddy](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/WorkoutBuddy/) website, then if a banner/pop-up shows up, asking if you want to install the app, then accept.

For mobile users :

### Additional information regarding PWA :

PWAs are basically apps like the ones you find in the app store on your mobile device, except you can install them directly from the browser. They're basically just opening a browser window specifically for them, to behave like a traditional app (native app). There are several advantages to PWAs, like being lightweight (you don't actually install everything like in a native app), access to most of the native features of a device, like notifications, vibrations, camera, speakers; which means you can pretty much do any kind of app with them.
